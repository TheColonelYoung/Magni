# Magni
Electric linear actuator powered by stepper motor. Based on 3D printed body with built-in bearing.

Actuator is easily modifiable, with with any length. There are only two parts which needs to be modified for greater length.
Project is designed in Onshape. Project can be downloaded or forked on this [link](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/d29122f55449fc9b32e37efc/w/e29782a3cd26bfe716aed0ac/e/d3b8e881492a84b656a9ecee)

Actual version have mounting holes for NEMA17 motor. Motion from motor is transmitted from motor to trapezoid rod via GT2 belt.
Belts are mounted on 30 teeth gears. Gears are printed from HIPS, so are more stiffer.
Ration between motor rotation and actuator shift is 3 mm shift per 1 rotation if motor.
Maximal achievable speed is around 20mm/s with common motor.
