# Magni
Electric linear actuator powered by stepper motor. Based on 3D printed body with built-in bearing.

Actuator is easily modifiable, with with any length. There are only two parts which needs to be modified for greater length.
Project is designed in Onshape. Project can be downloaded or forked on this [link](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/d29122f55449fc9b32e37efc/w/e29782a3cd26bfe716aed0ac/e/d3b8e881492a84b656a9ecee)

Actual version have mounting holes for NEMA17 motor. Motion from motor is transmitted from motor to trapezoid rod via GT2 belt.
Belts are mounted on 32 teeth gears. Gears are printed from HIPS, so are more stiffer.
Ration between motor rotation and actuator shift is 3 mm shift per 1 rotation if motor.
Maximal achievable speed is around 20mm/s with common motor.

Possible issue is with stability of push rod.
This can be resolved by mounting trapezoid into bearings.
But bearings need to be perfectly in line, because otherwise can be bearing damaged by turning of main rod.
Stability can be upgraded with better stability of body, this can be achieved by more mounting screws between gearbox and body.
